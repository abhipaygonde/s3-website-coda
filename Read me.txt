Tried to create the s3 website with CloudFormtion. 

Getting error in viewer certificate: CLoudFromtion stack is created and youc an cehck the error there.

But to complete the assignemnt and due to time limits not able to debugg the issue, I have manually created the S3 website with CLoudfront distribution. 

Custom domain name is mapped to the CloudFront domain name in Route53.
